# Upper case Converter aapp
#### This app was built buy me a computer science student at CESI EXIA
#### technologies used in this project: .Net core 9.0, WPF, c#, GIT
this app contains 2 versions

## V1:
The first Version of this app is a console application that asks user to input charachters from 1 to 8 and then convert those chars to upper case.
upper case, symbols and numbers are not taken into consideration and will remain as it is
the app will then show result and wait for user to exit the program.

## V2:
the second Version of the app has the same logic as the first Version but in a friendly UI built with WPF.

## V3 (coming soon):
will also convert to lowercase.


enjoy using this dumb app
